Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrowâ€”vainly I had sought to borrow

Let me go
My going is a 
Great event you know
Keeping progress
In relations with all. 

Blue sky, 
blue sky.

Looking at you, wishing the day by.
